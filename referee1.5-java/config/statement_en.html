        <br>
        <br>
        Instead of choosing one card from each of 30 sets, now a new, bigger set of <const>120</const> cards is generated every game. And player gets to freely build his deck out of the presented cards.
        <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, <const>Area</const> effect has been added.

        <span>Card Types</span>
      </h2>
        There are two different types of cards: <const>Creatures</const> and <const>Items</const>.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Creatures</strong><br>
      <ul style="padding-bottom:0">
        <li>
          Placing a creature card from the hand to the board is called <b>summoning</b>.<br>
          A player summons <const>creatures</const> to their side of the board by paying their cost in <strong>mana</strong>.
          They are used to attack the opponent and also serve as a defense against the creatures of the opposing player.
        </li><li>
          Creatures have a cost in mana, attack points and defense points.
          Some creatures start with certain abilities.
        </li><li>
          By default, creatures can't attack the turn they are summoned. They can attack once per turn only.
        </li><li>
          When a creature attacks another one, they both deal <strong>damage</strong> equals to their attack to the defense of the other creature. When a creature attacks the opponent, it deals <strong>damage</strong> equals to its attack to the HP of the opponent.
        </li><li> 
          Creatures are removed from play when their defense reaches <const>0</const> or less.
        </li><li>
          Creatures can have an effect on the player's health, the opponent's health or the card draw of the player when played.
        </li><li>
          Creatures can be placed on one of two lanes. Creatures on different lanes can not interact with each other.
        </li><li>
          Creatures can have different abilities:
          <ul style="padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0">
            <li>
              <const>Breakthrough</const>: Creatures with Breakthrough can deal extra <strong>damage</strong> to the opponent when they attack enemy creatures. If their attack <strong>damage</strong> is greater than the defending creature's defense, the excess <strong>damage</strong> is dealt to the opponent.
            </li><li>
              <const>Charge</const>: Creatures with Charge can attack the turn they are summoned.
            </li><li>
              <const>Drain</const>: Creatures with Drain heal the player of the amount of the <strong>damage</strong> they deal (when attacking only).
            </li><li style="color:#7cc576;background-color:rgba( 124 , 197 , 118 , 0.1 );padding:2px">
              <const>Guard</const>: Enemy creatures from the same lane must attack creatures with Guard first.
            </li><li>
              <const>Lethal</const>: Creatures with Lethal kill the creatures they deal <strong>damage</strong> to.
            </li><li>
              <const>Ward</const>: Creatures with Ward ignore once the next <strong>damage</strong> they would receive from any source. The "shield" given by the Ward ability is then lost.
          </ul>
        </li><li>

              <const>Lane1</const>: During summoning creature is cloned, and additional copy appears on the <strong>same</strong> lane (if there is free space).

            When played, <const>items</const> have an immediate and permanent effect on the board or on the players. They are then removed from play.

            Items have a cost in mana and one or multiple effects out of the following:

                <const>Red items</const> should target the opponent's creatures. They have a negative effect on them.
              </li><li>
                <const>Blue items</const> can be played with the "no creature" target identifier (<const>-1</const>) to give the active player a positive effect or cause <strong>damage</strong> to the opponent, depending on the card. Blue items with negative defense points can also target enemy creatures.
